<h3 class="step-header">Place ICs in Sockets</h3>

<div class="step-description">
        <p>The leads of the ICs must be slightly bent to fit perfectly into the sockets. For each IC, press one row of
                leads against a flat surface until they form a 90-degree angle with the body of the IC. Then do this for
                the other row.
        </p>
        <p>
                IC polarity is indicated by a dot or notch on one side of the body. Align this side with the notch in
                the sockets. Place all of the ICs in this direction, and press them completely into the sockets.
