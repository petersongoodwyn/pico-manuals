<h3 class="step-header">Populate Header Pins</h3>

<div class="step-description">
        <p>
                As with the header sockets, these pins must be perpendicular to the board to mate correctly. Follow the
                same technique:
        </p>
        <ol>
                <li>
                        Solder a single pad in the middle of the headerâ€™s footprint.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Place the header and press gently against the solder joint, while heating the edge of the
                        soldered pad.
                </li>
                <li>
                        After the solder liquifies and the header snaps into place, remove the soldering iron and hold
                        the header in place until the solder cools (about 5 seconds).
                </li>
                <li>
                        Now solder the rest of the pins of the header from underneath.
                </li>
        </ol>
