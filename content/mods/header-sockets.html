<h3 class="step-header">Populate Header Sockets</h3>

<div class="step-description">
        <p>It can be tricky to mount headers exactly perpendicular to the PCB. Our preferred technique is:</p>
        <ol>
                <li>
                        Fill a single pad in the middle of the header's footprint with solder.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Place the header and press gently against the solder joint while heating the edge of the
                        soldered pad.
                </li>
                <li>
                        After the solder liquifies and the header snaps into place, remove the soldering iron and hold
                        the header in place until the solder cools (about 5 seconds).
                </li>
                <li>
                        Now solder the rest of the pins of the header from underneath.
                </li>
        </ol>
