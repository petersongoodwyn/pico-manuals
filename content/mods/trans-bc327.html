<h3 class="step-header">Populate BC327 Transistors</h3>
    
<div class="step-description">
        <p>Note that there are two different types of transistors in this bag: some with silver markings on top and some without. Those without a marking are the BC327s. Place them in the positions that have an outline of the transistor instead of a filled-in shape. Make sure the transistors are aligned so the flat edge matches that of the outline on the board. Then solder and trim.</p>
