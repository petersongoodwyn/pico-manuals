<h3 class="step-header">Place IC in Socket</h3>

<div class="step-description">
        <p>The leads of the IC must be slightly bent to fit perfectly into the socket. Press one row of
                leads against a flat surface until they form a 90-degree angle with the body of the IC. Then do this for
                the other row.
        </p>
        <p>
                IC polarity is indicated by a dot or notch on one side of the body. Align this side with the notch in
                the socket. Place the IC in this direction, and press it completely into the socket.
