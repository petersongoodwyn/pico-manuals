<h3 class="step-header">Populate Transistors</h3>

<div class="step-description">
        <p>There are two important things to note about transistors. First, the orientation: one side of the body is flat while the other is round. And second, the part number: carefully check the markings on the sorting sheet against those on the body before inserting them.
        </p>
        <p>Identify the transistors, place them in the correct positions orientation, double check, and then solder and trim.
