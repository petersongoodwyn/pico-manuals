<div class="step-description">
    <p>Place the LED with the longer, positive lead in the "+" hole. Notice that the leads have a flat segment about 1/4" from the LED body. Insert the LED until the bottom of this flat segment, then bend it towards where the panel will be, solder it in place, and trim the leads.</p>
