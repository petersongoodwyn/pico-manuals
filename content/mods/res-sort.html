<div class="step-description">
    <p>Resistor values are identified by colored bands on the body of the resistor. To sort resistors, use our <a href="https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/pages/resistor-color-code-calculator" target="_blank">Resistor Color Code Calculator</a> or test them with a multi-meter set to read resistance. (Pro tip: to measure resistors quickly you can remove the probes from your multi-meter and place the leads of the resistor directly in the probe sockets.)</p>
