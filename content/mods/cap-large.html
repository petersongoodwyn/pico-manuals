<div class="step-description">
        <p>This capacitor is polarized, so it must be placed in a certain direction. The positive lead is slightly longer, while the negative lead is marked with a stripe on the body of the capacitor. Place the capacitor with the positive lead in the pad next to the "+" marking on the PCB. Double check the orientation, then solder and trim.</p>
